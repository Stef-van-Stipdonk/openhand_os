A reference to a descriptor, which you can load into a segment register; the selector is an offset into a descriptor table pointing to one of its entries. These entries are typically 8 bytes long, therefore bits 3 and up only declare the descriptor table entry offset, while bit 2 specifies if this selector is a GDT or LDT selector (LDT - bit set, GDT - bit cleared), 
bits 0 - 1 declare the ring level that needs to correspond to the descriptor table entry's DPL field. If it doesn't a General Protection Fault occurs; if it does correspond then the CPL level of the selector used is changed accordingly.
